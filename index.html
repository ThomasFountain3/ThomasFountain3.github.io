                <h2>Hey There</h2>
                <p>My name is Thomas Fountain III, a software developer from Cleveland, Ohio. My love for coding comes
                    from
                    developing clean, well put together and well tested projects that fit in any team environment. I
                    love learning new things that I can implement into my projects, as well as collaborating with other
                    fellow software developers on different project. Whether the task is big or small, I use strong
                    technical skills along with effective critical tinking abilities to find the best solution to any
                    problem I face. </p>

                <p>With this project being the first individual project I've ever done, it came out better than I
                    expected. Main goal was using basic Java functions in order to develop a Rocko "The Virtual Dog"
                    Here, you can feed, play, and give Rocko water in order to keep him happy. The goal of this is to
                    make sure that Rocko stays happy by completing the correct task in a timely matter; just like taking
                    care of a dog.

                <p>On this project, I used the same properties that I used on Rocko "The Virtual Dog" and I built on top
                    of that. Here, we've created multiple different pets that someone can choose what pet they want to
                    take home. You will be able to choose from a mulitude of pets, interact with them just like we did
                    on the first project. The goal for this project was to show the ability to create different
                    characters with their own individual characteristics.</p>
